# Todomvc-angular

> an angularjs implementation of the to-do application
> seems like the fastest way to learn angular

## Description
A classic todo app to learn angular js, The Application would contain lots of components with regards to communication between angular and node.


### The layout
The application layout is very simple, it has a central textbar in which one types in a task and on pressing enter the tasks gets persisted to database and the entire tasks get collected from the database.

### The backend
Well am not really the best guy when writing a readme, but let's see, the backend is created using node and mongoDb,
basically the backend only collects data from the front end via express urls and then save these data to the mongoDb,
It also retrieves information, i.e data from the database and then delivers a response for $https to work with.

### Featured.
In this project am gonna feature various components on angularjs namely
* components
* directives
* factories and services
* and possibly (no promises) lots of other goodies

> this project would be heavily commented so what out for them.
